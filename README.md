###About the Project

This project was made at DeltaHacks II over the span of 24 hours, which was proudly hosted by McMaster University.

The idea for this project was to connect less fortunate people with **FREE** events and resources close to them. We decided to call it **[NoNoWhere](http://nonowhere.com)** because it helps people find a direction.

    "I don't have anywhere to go."

becomes...

    "I don't not have somewhere to go."

Double negative... Not Nowhere... You're smart, you get it!

The types of resources and events we will have on our platform includes:

 - Soup Kitchens
 - Local Health Centers
 - Government Funded Employment Centers
 - Training Workshops & Seminars
 - And much, much more!
